# Update

I have been busy migrating my old site to Hugo instead of Jekyll. Also, I will use different template/subdomain for my notes instead of creating a chaos on a single main domain page.

My new site: https://cyberfront.me (With old and new content)

My Notes Wiki: https://wiki.cyberfront.me (Still under construction)

For the time being, I have my old website with all blogs and notes available here: https://legacy.cyberfront.me
